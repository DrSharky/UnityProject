# UnityProject
Started as a full game project, but had no direction.

Created "Breakout" project instead, more focused, has defined goals.

This repo is still here as some interesting miscellaneous scripts are contained within, random color stuff, etc.

It should be noted that the MouseLook and PlayerController scripts are not things I made myself, in case anyone is wondering.
